<h1> Django Bank Loan Machine Learning Model </h1>
<p> This project uses python, tensorflow and Django to determine whether a user would be approved or rejected for a loan </p>
<p> The front-end form is built in Django, with the machine learning model built in Tensorflow, and all of the data manipulation done in python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy and tensorflow</p>
<p> The machine learning model takes in 13 different factors from the user including:
<ul>
    <li>Dependents</li>
    <li>Applicant and CoApplicant Income</li>
    <li>LoanAmount</li>
    <li>Loan_Amount_Term</li>
